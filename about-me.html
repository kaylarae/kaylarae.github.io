Hello!!
"Language is the alchemy of turning thought into words", so I guess that makes me an alchemist. 
My name is Kayla Heno, and I have a B.A. degree in Advertising from Miami International University of Art and Design.
My strengths are primarily focused on public relations, copywriting, and any form of public speaking.
I hope you enjoy my work, and maybe I can help you turn your ideas into the perfect creation.
